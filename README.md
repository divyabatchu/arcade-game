The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. 
The player can move left, right, up and down. 
The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. 
Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. 
Once the player reaches the water the game is won.

The Enemy function, which initiates the Enemy by updating the update method of enemey function
The Player function, which initiates the Player by update & render function
You can add your own Player methods as needed.
