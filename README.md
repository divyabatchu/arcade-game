Frogger Game: Getting Started
In this project you will be building your own arcade game. Once finished, your game should look as shown on this video:

Game Description:
In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). 
The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. 
The player can move left, right, up and down. 
The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. 
Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. 
Once the player reaches the water the game is won.

Getting Started:

Inside the app.js file, you will need to implement the Player and the Enemy classes, using Object-Oriented JavaScript. 
The Enemy function, which initiates the Enemy by updating the update method of enemey function
The Player function, which initiates the Player by update & render function
You can add your own Player methods as needed.


Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
